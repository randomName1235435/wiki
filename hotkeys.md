Just Win. I hear you, "how can anyone not know that the Win key opens the Start menu?!", but many don't know that even in Windows 10 and 11 you can directly start typing after opening the Start menu (just clicking in it works too, but it's less convenient in this case) and Windows starts searching. This cool feature has been inherited from Windows 7 with same functional. Just press Win and type.
Win + X - contextmenu of startmenuâ€‹

Not that useful, but also interesting:

Win + H - open cool built-in speech recognition;
Win + S - open the search box (idk what's the point since previous #7);
Win + L - lock Windows (not logoff, processes keep running);
Win + . - open emoji menu (wait, did it exist?!);

Win + Tab - open a menu similar to alt + tab but with ability to switch among virtual desktops;
